Must be a positive value.\nIn the case of a sharing strategy, the distribution is following entities value (V) equals aggregated value (T) divided by sum of participation factors (PF), i.e. V=T/sum(PF). \nIn the case of priority strategy, the item with the lowest number gets allocated energy first.\ne.g. If 0 this grid alteration does not participate. The sum of all participation factors for all grid state alterations associated with same remedial action shall be equal to 100%.",
